## 🤝 Code of Conduct

By participating in this project, you are expected to uphold our code of conduct. Please be respectful and constructive in all interactions.

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Fork the repository** on GitHub
2. **Clone your fork** locally:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/runanywhere-sdks.git
   cd runanywhere-sdks
   ```
3. **Set up the development environment** (see [Development Setup](#development-setup))
4. **Create a new branch** for your feature or bug fix:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

## 🛠️ Development Setup

### Prerequisites

**For Android Development:**
- Android Studio Arctic Fox or later
- JDK 11 or later
- Android SDK with API level 24+

**For iOS Development:**
- Xcode 15.0+
- Swift 5.9+
- macOS 10.15+

### Environment Setup

1. **Install pre-commit hooks** (recommended):
   ```bash
   pip install pre-commit
   pre-commit install
   ```

2. **Android SDK Setup:**
   ```bash
   cd sdk/runanywhere-kotlin/
   ./scripts/sdk.sh android
   ```

3. **iOS SDK Setup:**
   ```bash
   cd sdk/runanywhere-swift/
   swift build
   ```

## 🔧 Making Changes

### Branch Naming Convention

- `feature/description` - for new features
- `bugfix/description` - for bug fixes
- `docs/description` - for documentation updates
- `refactor/description` - for code refactoring

### Commit Message Format

We follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification:

```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

**Types:**
- `feat`: A new feature
- `fix`: A bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation only changes
- `style`: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code
- `refactor`: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- `test`: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
- `chore`: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools

**Examples:**
```
feat(android): add cost tracking to generation results
fix(ios): resolve memory leak in model loading
docs: update README with new API examples
```

## 📤 Submitting Changes

1. **Ensure your code follows our style guidelines** (see [Code Style](#code-style))
2. **Add or update tests** for your changes
3. **Run the test suite** to ensure nothing is broken:
   ```bash
   # Android
   cd sdk/runanywhere-kotlin/
   ./scripts/sdk.sh test-android
   ./scripts/sdk.sh lint

   # iOS
   cd sdk/runanywhere-swift/
   swift test
   swiftlint
   ```
4. **Commit your changes** with a clear commit message
5. **Push to your fork**:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```
6. **Create a Pull Request** on GitHub with:
   - Clear title and description
   - Reference to any related issues
   - Screenshots or examples if applicable

### Pull Request Guidelines

- **Keep PRs focused** - one feature or bug fix per PR
- **Write clear descriptions** - explain what and why, not just how
- **Update documentation** if your changes affect the public API
- **Add tests** for new functionality
- **Ensure CI passes** - all checks must be green

## 🎨 Code Style

### Android (Kotlin)

- Follow [Kotlin coding conventions](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/coding-conventions.html)
- Use 4 spaces for indentation
- Maximum line length: 120 characters
- Run `./gradlew ktlintFormat` to auto-format code

### iOS (Swift)

- Follow [Swift API Design Guidelines](https://swift.org/documentation/api-design-guidelines/)
- Use 4 spaces for indentation
- Maximum line length: 120 characters
- Run `swiftlint` to check style compliance

### General Guidelines

- **Use meaningful names** for variables, functions, and classes
- **Write self-documenting code** with clear intent
- **Add comments** for complex logic or business rules
- **Avoid deep nesting** - prefer early returns and guard clauses
- **Keep functions small** and focused on a single responsibility

## 🧪 Testing

### Writing Tests

- **Unit tests** for business logic and utilities
- **Integration tests** for API interactions
- **UI tests** for critical user flows (example apps)

### Running Tests

```bash
# Android SDK tests
cd sdk/runanywhere-kotlin/
./scripts/sdk.sh test-android

# iOS SDK tests
cd sdk/runanywhere-swift/
swift test

# Android example app tests
cd examples/android/RunAnywhereAI/
./gradlew test

# iOS example app tests
cd examples/ios/RunAnywhereAI/
xcodebuild test -scheme RunAnywhereAI -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 15'
```

### Test Coverage

We aim for high test coverage, especially for:
- Core SDK functionality
- API interfaces
- Error handling
- Edge cases

## 🐛 Reporting Issues
