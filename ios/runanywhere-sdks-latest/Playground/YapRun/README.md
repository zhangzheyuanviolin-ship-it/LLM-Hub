# YapRun

On-device voice dictation for iOS and macOS, powered by the RunAnywhere SDK. All speech recognition runs locally — your voice never leaves your device.

## Features

### iOS

- **Custom Keyboard Extension** — Tap "Yap" from any text field in any app to dictate with on-device Whisper
- **Live Activity** — Real-time transcription status on the Lock Screen and Dynamic Island
- **Model Hub** — Download and switch between multiple ASR models (WhisperKit Neural Engine, ONNX CPU)
- **ASR Playground** — Record and transcribe in-app to test speed and accuracy
- **Notepad** — Built-in scratchpad for quick voice drafts
- **Guided Onboarding** — Step-by-step setup for microphone, keyboard, and model download
- **Deep Links** — `yaprun://startFlow`, `yaprun://playground`, `yaprun://kill` for keyboard ↔ app communication

### macOS

- **Menu Bar Agent** — Runs as a background agent with a persistent menu bar icon
- **Global Hotkey** — System-wide keyboard shortcut to dictate and insert text at the cursor
- **Flow Bar** — Floating overlay showing dictation status
- **Hub Window** — Model management, playground, notepad, and settings in a single window

### Shared (iOS + macOS)

- **Multiple ASR Backends** — WhisperKit (Apple Neural Engine via Core ML) and ONNX (CPU via sherpa-onnx)
- **Model Registry** — Curated models with consumer-friendly names: Fast (70 MB), Accurate (134 MB), Compact CPU (118 MB), Whisper CPU (75 MB)
- **Offline-Ready** — Download once during setup, run without a network connection
- **Dictation History** — Recent transcriptions stored locally with timestamps

### Key Patterns

- **Flow Session (WisprFlow pattern)**: The keyboard extension triggers the main app via deep link (`yaprun://startFlow`). The app starts `AVAudioEngine` while foregrounded, keeps alive via Live Activity, then receives Darwin notifications (`startListening` / `stopListening`) from the keyboard to gate audio buffering and transcription.
- **Dual Runtime**: WhisperKit runs on Apple Neural Engine (Core ML) for speed; ONNX via sherpa-onnx runs on CPU as a fallback.
- **Shared Data Bridge**: App and keyboard extension communicate through a shared `UserDefaults` suite and Darwin notifications — no network calls.

## Requirements

| Platform | Minimum | Recommended |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| iOS      | 16.0    | 17.0+       |
| macOS    | 14.0    | 15.0+       |
| Xcode    | 15.0    | 16.0+       |

## Getting Started

1. Open the project in Xcode:

```bash
cd Playground/YapRun
open YapRun.xcodeproj
```

2. Select the **YapRun** scheme and your target device/simulator.

3. Build and run. The onboarding flow will guide you through microphone permission, keyboard setup, and model download.

> **Keyboard Extension**: To use the custom keyboard on iOS, go to **Settings → General → Keyboard → Keyboards → Add New Keyboard** and select **YapRun**. Enable **Full Access** when prompted.

## Models

All models are downloaded from GitHub Releases and cached on-device:

| Model | Backend | Size | Best For |
|-------|---------|------|----------|
| Fast (whisperkit-tiny.en) | WhisperKit / Neural Engine | 70 MB | Quick notes, low battery |
| Accurate (whisperkit-base.en) | WhisperKit / Neural Engine | 134 MB | Longer dictation, higher accuracy |
| Compact CPU (moonshine-tiny-en-int8) | ONNX / sherpa-onnx | 118 MB | When Neural Engine is busy |
| Whisper CPU (whisper-tiny.en) | ONNX / sherpa-onnx | 75 MB | Maximum device compatibility |
